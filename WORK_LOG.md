| 11/15 | 10:20 - 11:00am | I discussed an approach with Lucas and started trying to write the code based on counting the number of consecutive values and converting them to base10 values. |
| 11/19 |  9:00 - 9:45am  |                                       I realized that the code wasn't working right because of the way I was separating the data. I began to try a new approach. |

| 11/19 | 10:25 - 11:00pm |                                                                                                    I started rearranging my code to have it work for bit values. |
| 11/19 | 11:05 - 11:15pm |                                                              I continued to work through a problem I was having with identifying which value the current bit is. |
