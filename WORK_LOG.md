| 11/15 | 10:20 - 11:00am |                       I discussed an approach with Lucas and started trying to write the code based on counting the number of consecutive values and converting them to base10 values. |
| 11/19 |  9:00 - 9:45am  |                                                             I realized that the code wasn't working right because of the way I was separating the data. I began to try a new approach. |
| 11/19 |  9:15 - 9:45pm  |                                                                                                                  I thought through the idea of using bits instead of the whole String. |
| 11/19 | 10:25 - 11:00pm |                                                                                                                          I started rearranging my code to have it work for bit values. |
| 11/19 | 11:05 - 11:15pm |                                                                                    I continued to work through a problem I was having with identifying which value the current bit is. |
| 11/22 |  1:00 - 1:30pm  |                                                                                                    I thought through the ideas we discussed in class and started writing out the code. |
| 11/22 |  1:30 - 1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                             I spent time in class discussing the code. |
| 11/29 |  8:35 - 8:55pm  |                                   I wrote the code for the basic ideas of what we talked about in class. I wanted to save this version before testing and tweaking if it doesn't work. |
| 11/29 |  8:55 - 9:30pm  | I tested my code and ran into errors regarding the compression and expansion relationship. My code isn't compressing correctly and either makes the code more bits or turns it into 0. |
| 11/29 | 9:50 - 10:20pm  |                                                                                                                    I tried to approach solving by using a boolean instead of a String. |
